Background
This initiative was initially conceptualised through a workshop held as part of the QLD Water Panels biennial symposium October 2021 “Workshop: What are the challenges to deliver a successful modelling project?” Since that time it has remained on the QLD Water Panels list of initiatives, but a lead with sufficient time to commit to the initiative has not been available.
